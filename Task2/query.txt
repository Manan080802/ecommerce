1. Find User wise - product-wise ordering quantity with total item value
select users.id,users.email,Products.id,Products.name,sum(Order_items.quantity),sum(Order_items.item_value)  from users

join
	Orders
on

join
	Order_Items
on
	orders.id = Order_Items.order_id

2.Weekly Orders analysis for the first quarter of 2024
##note: I do not have information for the first quarter of 2024. However, I have prepared a query to calculate the number of orders per minute
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MINUTE  FROM  Orders.created_at) AS minute_number,
    COUNT( Orders.id) AS total_orders,
    SUM( Orders.total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    Orders
WHERE 
    Orders.created_at >= '2024-11-16 01:00:00' AND Orders.created_at < '2024-11-16 23:59:00'
GROUP BY 
    minute_number
ORDER BY 
    minute_number;

-------Weekly data of first quarter of 2024---------------------
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(WEEK  FROM  Orders.created_at) AS week_number,
    COUNT( Orders.id) AS total_orders,
    SUM( Orders.total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    Orders
WHERE 
    Orders.created_at >= '2024-01-01' AND Orders.created_at < '2024-03-31'
GROUP BY 
    week_number
ORDER BY 
    week_number;




3.Retrieve the Product name and No. of Orders from Sales. Exclude products with fewer than 5 Orders
SELECT 
    Products.name,count(Order_items.id)  
FROM 
    Products
Join
    Order_Items
on
    Products.id = Order_Items.product_id
GROUP BY
	Products.name
HAVING
	count(Order_items.id)>5
order by
	count(Order_items.id) DESC





4.Find the products that are sold more than 7 times or have not sold yet in the first quarter of 2024
SELECT 
    Products.name,count(Order_items.id)  
FROM 
    Products
Join
    Order_Items
on
    Products.id = Order_Items.product_id
JOIN
	Orders
on
	Order_Items.order_id = Orders.id
WHERE
	Orders.created_at >= '2024-01-01' AND Orders.created_at < '2024-04-01'
GROUP BY
	Products.name
HAVING 
  COUNT(Order_Items.order_id) > 7 OR COUNT(Order_Items.order_id) = 0
order by
	count(Order_items.id) DESC
